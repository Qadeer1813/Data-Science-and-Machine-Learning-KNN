# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to predict the classifcation of a car based on multiple factors.

# Data Source
The dataset that was used for this project can be downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation

# Data
Attributes
- buying       v-high, high, med, low
- maint        v-high, high, med, low
- doors        2, 3, 4, 5-more
- persons      2, 4, more
- lug_boot     small, med, big
- safety       low, med, high

Classes
- unacc
- acc
- good
- vgood

# Processing
After downloading this dataset, a test print was conducted using the following code ```data.head()```. The loaded data was then displayed. A check was done to find missing values in the dataframe using the following code ```missing_values = data.isnull().sum()```, ```print(missing_values)```. This found no missing values in the dataset. One hot encoding was then done on the following columns ```buying```,	```maint```,	```doors```,	```persons```, ```lug_boot```, ```safety```. The data was then split into features and target variable. The target variable was ```class```. Data was then split into training and testing set 70%  training and 30% testing. SMOTE was applied to help the class imbalance as ```unacc``` and ```acc``` had much more samples. After this finding the best number of neighbours for KNN using F1 score. 

# Data Understanding and Visualisation 
After processing the data and finding the best neighbours which was 11 the model was fit

# Algorithims:
K Nearest Neighbour: This is a supervised machine learning algorithm which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of data point. In this project the classification of cars based multple factors was done.
